        Loona (stylized as LOOΠΔ) is a South Korean girl group formed by Blockberry Creative.
        Its twelve members were revealed in a periodic fashion, corresponding to their Korean name Idarui Sonyeo (이달의 소녀), which translates to "Girl of the Month".

        Loona commenced their pre-debut project in October 2016, with each member releasing a promotional single over the next eighteen months.
        The group has formed three sub-units: Loona 1/3, Loona Odd Eye Circle and Loona yyxy.
        Their debut EP as a full ensemble, [+ +] (2018), was supported by the lead single "favOriTe" and the title track "Hi High."
